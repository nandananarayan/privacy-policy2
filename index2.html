                  2. If an account is permanently deleted after the cool-off period, such deletion is irreversible, and you will not regain access. All third-party accounts connected to this deleted account will be automatically disconnected, and you will not be able to log in with these third-party accounts.
                  3. Upon deletion, you will lose access to all content, including information, data, and records associated with your account.

                  5. Once you agree to delete, the relevant terms of service and other rights with Probatomic will terminate accordingly, except for those that have been agreed to continue in effective or as otherwise prescribed by laws and regulations. You will also no longer enjoy the user rights outlined in the "Privacy Policy," except as otherwise mandated by laws and regulations or required by regulatory authorities.</p>

                 If we have reasonable grounds to suspect or discover that your account is engaged in activities violating our Terms of Service, Privacy Policies, or any applicable regulations, we reserve the right to refuse your deletion request, halt the account deletion process, or prohibit the registration of a new user account with the same email associated with your account.</p>
                 <h4>Account Deletion Restriction Notice:</h4>
